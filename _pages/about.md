HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Tianjian! I'm a 1st/3rd year PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, proudly advised by Prof. [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/). Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at JHU, where I had the privilege of working closely with my wonderful advisors, [Kenton Murray](https://kentonmurray.com/) and [Philipp Koehn](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/), focusing on multilingual NLP.

My research interest lies at the intersection of **machine learning** and **natural language processing**, with a particular focus on addressing the question: **how can we better leverage our vast amount of data beyond simply feeding it into our models during training?** To this end, I am currently working on measuring various properties of data (e.g. quality) and curating data for training and aligning our language models.

I prefer solutions that are simple, generalizable, and theoretically sound.

If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: tli104 at jhu.edu
