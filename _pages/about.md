My name is Tianjian Li. I have received my B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from New York University. I am now pursuing a M.S. degree at Johns Hopkins University. My advisors are [Kenton Murray](https://kentonmurray.com/) and [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/). I am also grateful to have the opportunity to work closely with [Philipp Koehn](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/).

My research interest lies in the intersection of **machine learning** and **natural language processing**, with a particular focus on **measuring and selecting data** for training/aligning language models.

I prefer solutions that are simple, generalizable, and theoretically sound.

If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: tli104 at jhu.edu
