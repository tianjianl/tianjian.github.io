HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Tianjian! I'm an incoming PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, where I will be working with Prof. [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/). I also did my Master's degree in Computer Science at JHU. I am grateful to have the opportunity to work closely with [Kenton Murray](https://kentonmurray.com/) and [Philipp Koehn](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/) on multilingual language models and machine translation during my Master's.

My research interests lies at the intersection of **machine learning** and **natural language processing**, with a particular focus on addressing the question: **how can we better leverage our vast amount of data beyond simply feeding it into our models during training?** To this end, I am currently working on measuring various properties of data (e.g. quality and utility), optimizing data mixtures, and curating data for training and aligning our language models.

I prefer solutions that are simple, generalizable, and theoretically sound.

If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: tli104 at jhu.edu
