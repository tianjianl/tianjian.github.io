3 papers are accepted to NAACLðŸŽ‰, which includes [my work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04579) on training on heavily imbalanced datasets, [Jack's work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03862) on making language models produce verbatim quotes from training data, and [Yining's work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09007) on evaluating the creativity of language models on code generation. I am super grateful to my wonderful co-authors!
